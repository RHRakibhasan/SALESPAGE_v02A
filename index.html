              <p> What if a comfortable retirement was as easy as buying one, two, or three stocks… </p>
              <p>Then just sitting back and collecting the income for life? </p>
              <p> No day trading…watching the markets…or looking for the next hot stock.</p>
              <p> Here’s the catch, though… </p>
              <p>Are you ready?</p>
              <p>The stocks I’m going to show you today ARE NOT companies you’ll hear about on the news.</p>
              <p>They aren’t trying to put people on Mars, cure cancer, or invent the next social media.
                Far from it, in fact.</p>
              <p>They’re companies in the most important areas of society…I’m talking real estate, energy, finance…
                But, here’s where it gets interesting.</p>
              <p>These companies are bringing in a ton of cash each month…and they want to pay that cash out to you for

                owning the stock.</p>
              <p>One stock I recommend is throwing off over 15% in dividends each year…
                Another over 12%… </p>
              <p><b>Buy these stocks now and hold them forever.</b></p>
              <p>But I won’t stop that.</p>
              <p> What if you could turn buying these high yields into a cash cow for years to come…think about what’s
                possible.</p>
              <p>John S. just emailed us in December, saying “[I’ve built] my income from $4,500 to $8,500/month…in two
                years.”</p>
              <p>John has nearly doubled his income by following my simple buy and hold strategy.</p>

              <p>
                A recent CNN poll revealed the #1 fear of retirees is running out money. </p>
              <p>Let me repeat that: today’s retirees fear running out of money more than anything in the world,
                including

                death. </p>
              <p>You’re forced to depend on the government or get charity from family if you don’t have any money. Maybe

                even rely on strangers. </p>
              <p>Living off Social Security alone is tough, already seeing as the average monthly check is $1,341,
                according to Investopedia. </p>
              <p>I’ve surveyed thousands of investors, and this same concern continues to pop up. </p>
              <p>I have an Excel spreadsheet with over 1,000 detailed responses from retirees. I asked them directly:
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

              <a href="a">“What’s your biggest fear financially?”</a>
              <p>The #1 answer, by far, was “I am afraid I’ll run out of money and go broke.” </p>
              <p>That’s when I decided to put together this 36-month income battle-plan. </p>
              <p>If you’re prepared to be a disciplined and consistent investor, this plan will be your saving light.
              </p>
              <p>Because in retirement, you need to be focused on income if you want your money to outlive you. Living
                stress-free without taking a part-time job requires regular cash flow. </p>
              <p><b>I’ve calculated 36 months as the ideal runway needed to create your own, personal money tree.I’ve
                  done the math myself for you.</b> </p>
              <p>At the end of 36 months, you’ll have a virtually passive income stream. You only need to check up on
                1-2x

                per month. </p>
              <p><b>Our entire goal with the 36-month plan is to lay the groundwork in our portfolio for massive
                  income. That’s it, plain and simple.</b> </p>
              <p>Income pays your bills, hence our focus. </p>
              <p>And you’ll be shocked how little the risk is to do this… </p>

                Thanks to my easy-to-follow, virtually passive method, you’ll have awesome days where income
                automatically

                shows up in your account. </p>
              <p> You’ll feel that stress sitting in your chest disappear. You’ll start living in the present again
                ratherthan worrying
                about the future. </p>
              <p>The simple, joyful things in life, like getting together for dinner with your friends won’t be a
                budgeting

                nightmare. </p>
              <p>You’ll have enough saved to weather any unexpected medical bills or house repairs. Even being in
                aposition to give more to your grandchildren’s fundraisers. Plus, they will be no more fears about being
                forced to pull out the credit card and go into debt. </p>
              <p>It’s freedom. Freedom to spend your time as you want without any outside pressures. You won’t need to
                make concessions to pay that inflated gas bill in the winter months. You’ll enjoy the freedom of not
                relying on others.</p>
              <p>Freedom is a beautiful thing. </p>

                Hello. My name is Tim Plaehn. I am the architect behind this accelerated income plan. </p>
              <p> I started my career off serving as an F-16 fighter pilot in the United States Air Force while studying

                mathematics. </p>
              <p> I went on to become an instructor, a position reserved for the highest-achieving pilots. </p>
              <p> After serving, I spent eight years as a stockbroker and licensed financial advisor. </p>
              <p> I honestly struggled for years to make money for both myself and my clients. None of the “complicated”
                trading methods touted worked or made any sense. Those who taught them seemed only interested in making
                themselves rich, not my clients. </p>
              <p> It wasn’t until I discovered the math behind this 36-month plan that everything clicked. Rather than
                searching for ‘hot stocks,’ I now invest already knowing how much income I’ll generate. </p>

            That’s the beauty of this accelerated income plan. </p>
          <p> You’ll know exactly how much you’ll receive each month to pay your bills. Plus, you’ll have some leftover
            to

            spend guilt-free. </p>
          <p> I’ve made showing retirement investors how to do this my mission. </p>
          <p>I am near the retirement age of most Americans… though I have no plans to slow down anytime soon. I see
            what’s going on with pensions drying up and Social Security checks not keeping up with inflation. </p>
          <p> I didn’t grow up wealthy nor did I have a massive account to start investing. I started off like most
            Americans…I had a small account. Sometimes, even went broke. </p>
          <p> Yet, I’ve already created a secure income stream for myself using the exact strategies I’m showing you.

              <p> Capital gains don’t pay the bills. It’s not ‘real’ money until it’s in your checking account. </p>
              <p> But the only way to capture those gains is by doing something crippling… </p>
              <p> You have to sell your stocks to receive the profits. </p>
              <p> Say you invested in Google in 2010. Through 2017, you would’ve seen a nice 264% winner after 7 years.

                point, you’ll likely need more income. </p>
              <p> So, you look for another stock. Suddenly, you’re paralyzed because what if the next stock doesn’t

                ground. By pulling out the roots, it will produce zero apples in the future. </p>
              <p> You’ll enjoy the hundreds of apples it grew over the years — but at some point, those apples will be
                gone… </p>

              <p> The next apple tree you plant may not grow as well as the first one or it may even die to due

              <p> If one tree ever starts withering, you’d rip it out and plant a new one… all while still having other
                fertile trees bearing
                fruit.</p>
              <p> This short parable illustrates the difference between investing in capital gains and for income.</p>
              <p> I recommend income investing to retirees every day… and I’m so confident in it, I have my parents
                doing
                it.</p>
              <p> My folks retired at age 62. They ran the numbers with their advisor expecting to live to age 74. Well,
                today, they are 86. They’re entire financial plan their advisor put together was shot to hell.</p>
              <p> Now, they are set up with reliable income each month and living comfortably.</p>

                Stock prices will swing wildly. Watching them too much could compel you to make an emotional decision.
              </p>

              <p> Share prices go up and down due to an imbalance of buyers and sellers. If more buyers exist than
                sellers, the stock will go up due to demand.</p>
              <p> Higher share prices bring out the greed in investors. Many will hold onto their stocks thinking it
                will
                go up forever.Those who don’t own the stock will feel they are “missing out” and potentially buy when
                the stock
                peaks. </p>

              <p>Soon, the stock is accelerating upwards at breakneck speeds not because the underlying company is doing
                well…but simply by human greed. </p>
              <p>Just look at Tesla stock. In 2013, it was trading for $36. By the end of 2017, it skyrocketed to $350.
                An 872% increase. </p>
              <p> Tesla loses money by the bundle. And the losses are getting bigger…</p>

            Still, the stock hits record highs as we speak. </p>
          <p> Even Elon Musk, Tesla’s founder and CEO, admitted the stock price “is higher than we have the right to
            deserve.” </p>
          <p> It’s all greed and emotional investing — a recipe for future losses. </p>
          <p> This exact same process happens, but in reverse, for stocks plunging. Sellers are scared of falling
            prices.

            <h3> Why The Average Investor Struggles During Retirement</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="gray-bg-section pl-70 pr-70">
        <div class="row">

            <div class="common-pera ">
              <p>
                Here’s what the average investor is doing. </p>
              <p> Say you have $250,000 saved up to retire on. Your Social Security check pitches in $1,341 per month.
              </p>
              <p> You believe you only need $4,000 per month to live comfortably on. You may need more or less. New
                Retirement reports the average income is $48,000/year for retirees. </p>
              <p> So, after Social Security, you need only to generate $2,500 per month to live on </p>
              <p> Leading up to retirement, you’d invested in big-name blue chips…Microsoft,, McDonald’s, Disney. </p>
              <p> Over 20 years, you saw these stocks skyrocket. </p>
              <p> If you look at the last seven years since the crash in 2009, all three of these blue-chips have done
                remarkabl
                well. </p>
              <p> Starting in 2010, Microsoft stock is up around 171%…Disney’s gaining around a similar trajectory at
                just over 183%. McDonald’s has returned around 147%. </p>
              <p> At these growth rates, you’d be netting around 20% per year in capital gains. </p>
              <p> Sounds incredible, right? </p>
              <p> Thus, in retirement, you want to be prudent and figure you might as well invest more in blue chips
              </p>
              <p> Except, we all know the market never goes up forever. At some point, it will crash. Stocks will
                plummet.
              </p>

              <p> Look at Disney stock. In 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, Disney shed over 66% the following 24
                months. Or, in 2008, it lost 50.84% from August to April 2009 </p>
              <p> Your portfolio got sliced in half. </p>

              <p> It’s downright scary, actually. </p>
              <p> If you have $250,000 now, at 5% growth, but withdrawing your $2,500 per month to use for bills… </p>
              <p> You’re out of money in 10 years. </p>

                Clearly, hoping for endless bull markets won’t get you where you need to be. </p>

                  stay with them through the dark days.</p>

                <p> Meaning, we don’t panic if our stock goes
                  down 10% because eventually, it will go up
                  again. </p>
                <p> When it goes down 10%, we buy more of the
                  stock and pick it up at a nice discount because
                  we’re picking up the income along the way…
                  and that’s what this system is all about: cash
                  income.

                Another play in my private portfolio leases commercial jets. In 2009, they got hit hard like other

                I’ve dedicated my career to one specific type of stock, which generates regular income every month. </p>
              <p> As you might’ve guessed, I’m talking about dividend stocks — ever-dependable and predictable
                dividends.
              </p>

              <p> But, not just any dividend stocks. I’m focused solely on high-yield dividend stocks. </p>
              <p> These are companies that pay above-average dividends each quarter (some every month). It’s not unusual
                to

                see 7.9%…11.6%…even 21.2% yields. </p>
              <p> All paid out regularly, like a paycheck. Meaning, you know exactly how much you’ll make every month.
              </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>1. Dividends are real returns. They won’t disappear when a share price goes down.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p> 2. Where else do you get 8%…12%…20% yields?</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p> 3. Dividends are more predictable than share prices.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p> 4. A higher yield makes the power of compounding exponential.</p>

                  <li>

                    Many dividend stocks we invest in are expected to increase their pay-outs each year. This means you

                  <p> Many of the plays in my dividend portfolio have been compounding income for years —
                    overvalued
                    stocks I sell. And stocks with a risky dividend about to be cut, too. </p>

                  <p> If you had followed my 36-month plan with this play, here’s where you’d be now. </p>
                  <p>You’d be making a steady $2,015 each month. </p>
                  <p> Over 10 years, that’s $241,800 in income alone. </p>

                    That’s just one example. </p>
                  <p> Going into my various plays, my research told me the stocks were selling for cheap and that’s why
                    we
                    have capital gains.</p>
                  <p> But, again, that’s not what we’re banking on. Capital gains are excellent for when we need to
                    unload
                    shares and reinvest the profits for more income. But that’s all they’re for. </p>
                  <p> Our main focus is the high yield. </p>
                  <p> Dividend stocks pay you consistently whether we’re invested in a raging bull market or a bleeding
                    bear
                    one. </p>
                  <p> One of my insider plays reserved for subscribers kept paying their $0.52 dividend per share even
                    when
                    the
                    share price cut in half. </p>
                  <p> We’ve been buying shares for even less now and earn over a 20% yield on our investment today. </p>

                Now, how do we find these high-yield companies? </p>
              <p> Normally, companies paying out large sums are not “household names.” Household-name blue chips
                typically


                pay 1-3% yields. That’s not enough to retire on. We have to dig deeper to find income-producing
                companies. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="gray-box mb-30">
              <p><b>To be successful, you only need two criteria:</b> </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>1) The company is growing in the next 3-5 years. If a company isn’t growing, it’s declining.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>2) The dividends have a track record of increasing or staying steady.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <p>
                All of Warren Buffett’s top 5 dividend holdings have rising dividends, and we’re following his lead.
              </p>
              <p> These criteria are imperative because all high yield companies aren’t strong businesses. I already
                showed you examples when I called the top of multiple companies. </p>
              <p> When I first started, I looked for the highest yield companies and invested there. Over and over I
                found out these companies were bad news and the stock would drop as much as 95%! </p>
              <p> Again, just searching for companies with the “highest yield” and picking a bad apple could destroy a
                portfolio. </p>
              <p> That’s why I spend much of my day in the trenches — talking with executives at these companies and
                making decisions based off what they say. </p>
              <p> You get a more complete company picture actually chatting with management than you will from a
                financial statement. </p>
              <p> On top of that legwork, I’m attending company presentations and investor conferences looking for
                opportunities. </p>
              <p> Again, these companies aren’t on the frontpage of Forbes. So, I must dig them up and sort winners from

                losers. </p>
              <p> Like this one, strong REIT I found handing out 15.7% yields every single year. That’s a guaranteed
                15.7%
                cash
                deposit as long as the dividend continues. </p>

              <p> It’s pretty exciting when you see money deposited and you didn’t do a lick of work.</p>
              <p> Retirement is supposed to be enjoyable after all. Why live in a constant state of fear the markets
                will collapse or not knowing how much to safely withdraw?</p>
              <p> The 36-month plan completely cuts out the fear of the unknown out.</p>
              <p> Because businesses are built and managed for the long-run…You and I need to invest the same way.</p>
              <p> And we want our capital in companies that value us as shareholders and who also have a goal of
                producin abundant cash flows.</p>
              <p>Their rising cash flow leads to increasing dividends for us.</p>
              <p> That’s the key difference from what other newsletters may tell you. They’re pushing you towards
                companies that might pop for big gains.</p>
              <p> In reality, it’s a friggin’ crap shoot.</p>
              <p>Your best bet is look for companies with an ever growing pipeline of cash. Cash is king.</p>
              <p> We focus more on cash and less time on how high the share price will go.</p>
              <p> Ironically, we actually want to see lower stock prices. That way we can invest less capital for shares
                but still collect the same income.</p>
              <p> Nothing causes more notes in my inbox than when the share price of a recommended company drops
                10-20%.</p>

            <p> <b>What is the DRIP?</b> </p>
            <p> It’s a Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The 36-month plan cannot work if you don’t do this critical step.
            </p>
            <p> While on the 36-month plan, we will be reinvesting all our dividends back into new shares. </p>
            <p>[BONUS]:: Brokers don’t charge $5 – $10 commissions to do this. It’s free. </p>
            <p> Remember, I didn’t pick “36 months” out of a hat. That’s the ideal timeframe to build an ever-growing
              money

            <p> With the right buying and selling moves, your overdue bills will literally vanish from your mailbox.</p>
            <p> The larger your portfolio, the faster you’ll see tremendous cash dividends. </p>
            <p> As you use DRIP, your income will continue to grow. If you’re able to reinvest when the share price is
              down, you’re getting more bang for your buck. </p>
            <p> With a $150,000 portfolio using the stock above, after using the 36-month plan, you could see a

            <p> Again, over 10 years, that’s a total of $398,269.20 in total income (not stock gains). Not to mention, a
              portfolio worth close to $300,000 which you could pass on to your children. </p>
            <p> As you add to your positions, the income will only balloon. </p>
            <p> Plus, your income doesn’t touch the principal. It’s all dividends. Your principal should keep
              compounding

              untouched. </p>
            <p> At this point, you have a full-blown accelerated income machine…an escalating income with a growing

            <p> With the 36-month accelerated income plan, you’ve created an orchard of ever-producing trees to feed you

              and your family for life. As one goes bad, you replace it with another while the others continue producing

                Hopefully, you feel I’ve been open with you here. I’m a straight-shooter. I don’t have time for
                investors
                chasing
                the ‘next big thing.’
                Others may see investing as a sport, like hunting or fishing. Not me. I invest with the discipline to
                grow
                my
                income. </p>
              <p> I wake up every morning in the Nevada hills at 5:30 am. I read the paper and study the markets.
                I’m not trying to win awards, recognition, or land on the Forbes 1000 list. I invest in high-yield
                stocks
                to fund
                my lifestyle. </p>
              <p> This 36-month plan isn’t some half-witted theory concocted from books. </p>
              <p> <b>It’s a calculated, math-driven solution to pay your bills for life.</b> </p>
              <p> Like I mentioned at the beginning, this won’t make you rich tomorrow. </p>
              <p> You save for your golden years in hopes of retiring rich. After you retire, you simply need income to
                enjoy the
                rest of your days. </p>
              <p> Dividend income, not capital gains, is how you get there. </p>
              <p> Is it the most exciting investment strategy ever? No, of course not. </p>
              <p> If you need to invest in a few penny stocks to get your adrenaline rush, by all means, go ahead. Just
                make
                sure </p>
              <p> you stay true to the plan I’ve laid out for you. </p>
              <p> Once you complete the plan, you’ll then take advantage of the second free bonus I have for you: The
                Monthly </p>

                    stability. I don’t care much about short-term share price movements, but it does provide a level of

                    <b> 5. Positive Surprises This Year:</b> Sleeper stocks who could boost their dividends without
                    notice. When the price spikes high, we are in a nice spot to dump the shares with our dividends and
                    gains in tow.
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not a “hot stock” picker. I don’t use some weird financial algorithm to try to find which
                    stocks
                    will
                    outperform. </p>
                  <p> My goal is to help you build a portfolio of high-yielding stocks that generate a steady and
                    growing
                    cash flow
                    stream. </p>
                  <p>These plays work to build your 36-month plan and beyond. </p>
                  <p> Again, the growing income stream is what will allow us to be in the stock market through both up
                    and
                    down
                    periods. </p>
                  <p>You’ll get regular updates on where you should be invested. Making these trades correctly keeps you
                    on track with the plan. For the most part though, we will kick back and enjoy our income stream.
                  </p>
                  <p> But, it’s imperative you know when and what to buy/sell. That’s how I can help you. </p>

              Because in investing… <b>time is money. Everyday you wait to start, is another day lost in dividend
                income.</b> </p>
            <p> You’ve seen calculated examples proving the 36-month plan works. <b> One example, you could start with
                as little as $25,000 and generate a $4,804 income stream. Not to mention, triple your account balance in
                the process. </b> </p>
            <p> If you have over 6-figures to invest, you’ll be amazed at how fast the dividend income will stack up.
            </p>
            <p> Remember, investing doesn’t have to be complicated or stressful if you don’t want it to be. This is an opportunity to make consistent income every month no matter what. We won’t be shooting for the stars or trying to find the next “Snapchat.” Leave that to speculators. </p>
            <p> You and I simply want a comfortable retirement where a medical bill comes in, then goes out paid without stress. We won’t need to call up our friends or family to help. We’ve worked hard to get here. It’s time to reap the benefits of your work. </p>
